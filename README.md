# Recurrence Analysis -- Mystery Function

Analyze the running time of the following recursive procedure as a function of
$n$ and find a tight big $O$ bound on the runtime for the function. You may
assume that each operation takes unit time. You do not need to provide a formal
proof, but you should show your work: at a minimum, show the recurrence relation
you derive for the runtime of the code, and then how you solved the recurrence
relation.

```javascript
function mystery(n) {
    if(n <= 1)
        return;
    else {
        mystery(n / 3);
        var count = 0;
        mystery(n / 3);
        for(var i = 0; i < n*n; i++) {
            for(var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for(var k = 0; k < n*n; k++) {
                    count = count + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        mystery(n / 3);
    }
}
```

might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

The recurrence relation can be expressed as $T(n) = 3T(n/3) + cn^3$ as the function makes 3 recursive calls of size n/3, and there are $n^3$ loop iterations.

We can use the base case T(1) = O(1) to solve our recurrence relation.

Let n = $3^i$ . This gives us $T(3^i) = 3T((3^i)/3) + c((3^i)^3)$ , which we can simplify to $T(3^i) = 3T(3^{i-1}) + c(3^{3i})$
